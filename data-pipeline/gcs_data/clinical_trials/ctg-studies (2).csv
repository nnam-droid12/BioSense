The evaluation organ depends on the specific condition of the treatment site and the tissue adjacent to the target area. Other adverse events included particle displacement, needle implantation transfer, and operation-related complications (bleeding, nerve injury, etc)., The side effects were completely observed after 2 years of follow-up.The follow-up interval was calculated from the completion of the treatment, once every 3 months in the first year and once every 6 months in the second year.","Local progression free survival, The length of time during and after the treatment of the head and neck tumors, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., The local progression free survival were completely observed after 2 years of follow-up.The follow-up interval was calculated from the completion of the treatment, once every 3 months in the first year and once every 6 months in the second year.|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from follow up to death., he overall survival were completely observed after 2 years of follow-up.The follow-up interval was calculated from the completion of the treatment, once every 3 months in the first year and once every 6 months in the second year.",,Peking University Third Hospital,,OBSERVATIONAL,2022-06-01,2026-05-28
